MOVE CORRESPONDING WS-RECORD TO DB-RECORD.

This seemingly innocuous statement can cause subtle bugs if the structures WS-RECORD and DB-RECORD are not perfectly aligned in terms of data types, lengths, and order of fields.  If a field in WS-RECORD is shorter than its counterpart in DB-RECORD, truncation can occur.  Conversely, if it's longer, it might overwrite adjacent fields leading to unpredictable behavior.  Different compilers might handle such mismatches differently, making debugging difficult.
